### Description:

Sarth is an e-commerce website that allows users to browse a wide catalog of video games. Users can purchase their desired video game(s) by adding them to their basket and checking out as a registered user. The games will be displayed with a brief description, cover picture, age rating, price, and will be categorised within genres such as Action, Mystery, Stealth etc. Our stakeholders will be people who enjoy playing video games as a hobby and our website will contain a wide range of games to reach as many target audiences as possible. The video game market typically adopts a more futuristic feel which we will display through varied colour schemes and layouts. Doing so provides us with a unique flair to appeal to our stakeholders. We have taken inspiration from websites such as Steam and Epic Games Launcher in the design of our website, though we plan to differ from these examples by making our website more user-friendly and attractive to the eye. Both these websites are quite monochromatic and confusing when you want to purchase a game. We will avoid this by utilising brighter, visually appealing colour schemes to keep users interested, as well as making sure that the website is easy to navigate.

##### Requirements: 
- PHP version: 8.1.10
- Laravel Version: 9.39.0
